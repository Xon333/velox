  Durations: 30s, 10m, 1h, 1h30m. Targets: single "65%" or range "95-105%". Optional cadence: "90rpm".
  Example: - 12m 95%
- Ramps: - 15m ramp 50-70%
- Repeats: put "Main Set 4x" (or just "4x") on its own line, then the steps to repeat below it.
  Leave one empty line BEFORE and AFTER every repeat block. Nested repeats are not supported.
- Plain-text lines without a leading "- " (e.g. "Warmup", "Cooldown") are section labels and are allowed.
- Free text before the duration inside a step becomes an on-screen cue: - Settle in 10m 60%
Full example:

Warmup
- 15m ramp 50-70%

Main Set 3x
- 12m 95%
- 4m 55%

Cooldown
- 10m 50%`;

BLOCK OVERVIEW
[2-3 sentence summary of the block's training approach and rationale]

WEEK [N]: [Week theme]
DAY [date]: [Session name]
  TYPE: [Workout type: Z2 / Threshold / VO2max / SIT / RaceSim / Recovery / Strength / Rest]
  DURATION: [minutes]
  WORKOUT: [Intervals.icu workout syntax per the syntax guide; for Rest days write "Rest"]
  DESCRIPTION: [Nutrition and intent description — see format below]

[Repeat for every day of the block]

DESCRIPTION FORMAT for each workout:
  Intent: [1 sentence on the physiological goal of this session]
  Execution: [Optional — one short pacing or technique cue for THIS session/terrain when it adds value (see execution-cue rule). Omit entirely when nothing useful applies.]
  Pre-ride: [Carbohydrate grams from the reference table]
  In-ride: [Carbohydrate grams/hr from the reference table, only for rides > 60 min]
  Post-ride: [Carbs and protein targets in grams from the reference table]
  Daily intake: [Total kcal for the day, copied from the reference table]

NUTRITION REFERENCE TABLE (pre-computed by the app's deterministic formula — copy these values, never calculate your own; pick the row matching the session's type and closest duration):

${nutritionTableMd}

Hard rules:
- Use ISO dates (YYYY-MM-DD) in every DAY line, exactly as listed above.
- DURATION is an integer number of minutes.
- TYPE must be one of: Z2, Threshold, VO2max, SIT, RaceSim, Recovery, Strength, Rest.
- **Interval protocols — match the knowledge base exactly:** SIT = 4–6 × 20–30s ALL-OUT efforts (maximal, 130–200% FTP) with 4 min easy recovery — never prescribe SIT as 1-minute or sub-130% efforts, and state the effort as "all-out / maximal" in the DESCRIPTION intent. VO2max = 3–8 min efforts at 106–120% FTP. Threshold = 88–105% FTP (sweet-spot 88–93%). Do not push a Threshold session above 105% or a VO2max session above 120%.
- **RaceSim (KB §10) — a peaking/sharpening session, not a base-week one:** a structured-but-variable race rehearsal — 3–6 "race moves" (e.g. 2–4 min climbs at 100–115% with short 30–60s standing attacks layered on, 3–6 min easy between), optional finishing sprint; whole-session IF ~0.80–0.88. Use it in the back half of a build / event lead-in, as one of the week's quality sessions. Best fit for this athlete's hilly-KOM goals.
- **Athlete-directed / terrain-flexible sessions (KB §11):** for outdoor quality you may prescribe a structured-but-flexible session instead of a fixed ladder — state target efforts as ranges (count · duration band · intensity band, e.g. "2–3 × ≥5 min @ threshold"), a placement rule ("on any sustained climb"), and a strict Z2 + HR-cap floor for the rest. Keep at least one fixed/ERG quality session per week as the controlled benchmark.
- **Execution cues (DESCRIPTION "Execution" line — grounded in the KB + this athlete's weakpoints; one short clause, only when it genuinely helps):**
  - **Long / endurance Z2 (esp. on hilly routes):** govern by the HR ceiling (top of Z2), not just watts — grey-zone drift is this athlete's known outdoor leak. On climbs let power drift up briefly but keep HR capped; ease on descents instead of surging (amateurs surge climbs and coast descents — the opposite of optimal).
  - **SIT:** stay seated — standing recruits upper body and gives less consistent power for the 30s aerobic efforts. **Standing sprints** are a separate skill (KB): cue them only on dedicated neuromuscular / race-sprint work or RaceSim attacks (hands in drops, rock the bike under a quiet torso, bigger gear) — this athlete has flagged out-of-saddle technique as a weakpoint worth practising.
  - **Rides with descents:** treat descents as deliberate practice for descending and cornering (known weakpoints) — work line choice and braking, not just recovery.
  Omit the Execution line for Rest days and whenever no cue adds value; never repeat the Intent.
  Keep every cue as concise *inline* coaching (a clause the athlete acts on mid-ride) — **never**
  tell them to watch a video, read an article, or include any external link/URL.
- Workout step durations must sum approximately to DURATION.
- **WEEKLY VOLUME (loading weeks):** Target ${settings.weeklyHoursMin}–${settings.weeklyHoursMax} hours total per week. Each loading week must reach at least ${settings.weeklyHoursMin}h.
- **WEEKLY VOLUME (recovery week):** Reduce to ${settings.recoveryWeekHoursMin}–${settings.recoveryWeekHoursMax} hours total.
- **WEEKLY STRUCTURE (loading weeks):** ${settings.qualitySessionsPerLoadingWeek} quality sessions (threshold/VO2max/SIT) + 1 long ${settings.polarisedApproach ? "Z2" : "Z2/sweet-spot"} ride (≥${settings.longRideDurationMinutes} min) + 2–3 easy Z2 sessions (60–90 min each) + ${settings.restDaysPerWeek} rest day${settings.restDaysPerWeek !== 1 ? "s" : ""} per week (avoid back-to-back hard days).${settings.polarisedApproach ? "\n- **Polarised structure:** Keep easy sessions genuinely easy (<0.75 IF). Avoid grey-zone moderate riding." : "\n- **Sweet spot structure:** Include sweet spot intervals (88–93% FTP) in addition to threshold work."}
- **Rest days:** TYPE: Rest, DURATION: 0, WORKOUT: Rest, description with Intent and Daily target only. Limit to ${settings.restDaysPerWeek} per week.
- Do not output anything before BLOCK OVERVIEW or after the final day.`;
