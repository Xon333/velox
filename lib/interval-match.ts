// rep is compared to the i-th executed work effort. Pure + deterministic.

// KNOWN LIMITATION (order-based alignment, RV-6): if a middle rep is skipped, every subsequent
// executed rep shifts up one slot (executed rep 4 gets scored against prescribed target 3). It's
// correct for the common case (all reps attempted, possibly under target) and for trailing extras
// (handled below), but a ragged, gap-in-the-middle session mis-aligns. No positional/time matching
// is attempted — Intervals' interval boundaries aren't reliable enough to align on.
