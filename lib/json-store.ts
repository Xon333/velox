// Crash-safe local JSON IO. The filesystem is this app's database, so writes must never leave
// a half-written file and an unrecoverable store must survive a corrupt write:
//
//  - Atomic write: serialise → temp file → fsync → rename. POSIX rename is atomic, so a crash
//    mid-write can never produce a truncated JSON — the old file stays intact until the new
//    one is fully on disk.
//  - Rolling backup: irreplaceable stores (the immutable ledgers, physiology history, blocks,
//    manual settings) snapshot their previous good version to `<file>.bak` before each write.
//  - Recovery on read: if the live file is missing or unparseable, fall back to `.bak`, then
//    to the caller's default — so a single bad write can't wipe the ledger.
//
// Regenerable stores (re-derivable from a fresh Intervals sync) get atomic writes but no
// backup — there's nothing worth recovering.
