// Power-PR detection: did the latest sync push the rolling power curve to a new best for a
// standard duration? Compares the freshly-synced curve against the curve as it stood on the
// PREVIOUS sync. Both sides are Intervals.icu's own curve math, so a rise is a genuine new best
// (the only new data since last sync is the latest ride) and the delta is the true watts gained.
//
// Why not mean-max the ride's power stream? That mixes two computations — a stream mean-max sits
// ~1W above Intervals' curve value for the same effort, which manufactured fake "+1W PRs" on every
// duration. Comparing curve-to-curve keeps the units honest. Pure + deterministic.

// 20m/30m/60m threshold-aerobic. Kept as its own literal (pr.ts is client-pure; it must not import
