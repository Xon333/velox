// the week. This closes that gap: a post-generation pass over the block's day sequence that flags
//   (a) two hard/quality days on consecutive calendar dates, and
//   (b) any week carrying more quality sessions than the loading-week budget.
//
// Deterministic: emits warnings only, never reorders the coach's plan — same contract as
// validatePlanProtocol. The generate route folds these straight into the plan's warnings array
// alongside the protocol checks.
