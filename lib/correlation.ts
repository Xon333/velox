// Generalises the guarded regression that `deriveTsbDeepFatigue` hard-coded: given the immutable
// ledger, find the level of a STAMPED signal at which THIS athlete's execution outcome degrades — but
// only when the signal genuinely DISCRIMINATES (failures separate from successes on the expected side)
// and clears a confidence gate; otherwise fall back to the population default. "Build the derivation
// once, reuse it" — the TSB adaptation edge is the first consumer; the morning-check strain edge is the
// second; carbs g/h plugs in the same way once a fueling input is stamped (Track C).
//
// Pure + deterministic: provenance comes from the immutable ledger, so each read re-derives identically.
// Depends only on ./types + ./stats (no ./calibration) so calibration.ts can consume it without a cycle.
