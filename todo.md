# NodeVelo — live punch-list

Short-lived tracker for **incoming bugs and feedback** — things to action soon, not strategy.
Keep it lean: when an item ships, move its one-line record to [ARCHIVE.md](ARCHIVE.md).

- **What's next / strategy** → [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- **Completed work** → [ARCHIVE.md](ARCHIVE.md)
- **Research spikes** → [research.md](research.md)

## ⛔ Hardening gate — clear before new ROADMAP features

From a self-review of the §5 / #1 / #3 / Track B work. **No new ROADMAP feature (#2, the
CoachSnapshot Today-surfacing WIP, etc.) until this clears.** `CR-1..3` are merge-blockers (real
bugs); the rest is the connective tissue that keeps the deterministic core honest.

| ID | S | Pri | Type | Item |
|----|---|-----|------|------|
| CR-1 | ☐ | P1 | bug | **Durability intensity is invisible to every guard.** Templates B/C/D ride as `TYPE Z2`, so `validateWorkoutProtocol` skips them ([`workout-validate.ts:24`](lib/workout-validate.ts)), `validateSchedule`'s quality-budget/spacing never counts them ([`schedule-validate.ts:19`](lib/schedule-validate.ts)), and the ledger scores them on duration only — the embedded threshold/VO2/sprint work is unchecked + unscored. Fix: type durability rides distinctly, or make both validators + the matcher look inside Z2. [`durability.ts`](lib/durability.ts) |
| CR-2 | ☐ | P1 | bug | **`PUT /api/morning-check` is unguarded.** It applies the downgrade without checking today's stored decision was `downgrade` or that the ride isn't already logged → can rewrite a cleared/ridden quality day. Refuse unless `decision==="downgrade"` and no `todayAnalysis` for today. [`app/api/morning-check/route.ts`](app/api/morning-check/route.ts) |
| CR-3 | ☐ | P1 | bug | **UTC `today` in routes breaks the `localToday` invariant.** `/api/ask` + `/api/morning-check` use `new Date().toISOString().slice(0,10)`; `MorningCheckIn` uses `localToday()` → client/server disagree across the UTC day boundary. Thread the client local date like `/api/sync` does (`resolveToday`). [`ask/route.ts`](app/api/ask/route.ts), [`morning-check/route.ts`](app/api/morning-check/route.ts) |
| CR-4 | ☐ | P2 | audit | **Reference KB is gitignored + unseeded.** A fresh clone generates against an empty KB and the durability prompt cites a "§12" that lives on one machine. Version the 3 reference files (keep `athlete_profile.md` + retrospectives local) or ship `.example` seeds. [`.gitignore:45`](.gitignore) |
| CR-5 | ☐ | P2 | bug | **ACWR computed two ways.** `/api/ask` uses bare `computeAcwr` (population bands) while Today/generate use `resolveAcwrBands(settings)` → Ask-Coach can contradict the readiness strip. Use calibrated bands wherever the snapshot is built. [`ask/route.ts`](app/api/ask/route.ts) |
| CR-6 | ☐ | P2 | bug | **No make-up slot ⇒ stimulus evaporates.** When no rest/easy day is free, the proactive path downgrades today and "carry to next block" is a comment, not code — the quality work is just lost. Persist it (retro seed / flag) or warn. [`reschedule.ts applyProactiveReschedule`](lib/reschedule.ts) |
| CR-7 | ☐ | P2 | bug | **Goal matcher has no negation.** "avoid hills" / "no racing" force a false RaceSim requirement; "granfondo"/"racecourse" false-negative. Tighten or document. [`session-requirements.ts`](lib/session-requirements.ts) |
| CR-8 | ☐ | P2 | audit | **Route/IO layer untested.** Pure helpers are covered; nothing asserts the ask route assembles the snapshot, generation injects the durability/RaceSim context, `validateSessionRequirements` is wired, or the morning-check POST/PUT transforms are right — exactly where CR-1..3 live. Add integration tests for the four routes. |
| CR-9 | ☐ | P2 | audit | **CoachSnapshot assembled twice, by hand.** Ask passes real today-data, generate passes nulls — drift risk. Extract one `buildCoachSnapshotFromStores()` both call. [`coach-snapshot.ts`](lib/coach-snapshot.ts) |
| CR-10 | ☐ | P2 | ux | **"Load-preserving" overclaimed.** Only the easy-day swap preserves load; the rest-day branch hardcodes 45-min Recovery (drops a 4 h day's volume + eats the rest day). Scale the downgrade to the volume target; soften the ROADMAP claim. [`reschedule.ts RECOVERY_DOWNGRADE_MIN`](lib/reschedule.ts) |
| CR-11 | ☐ | P2 | audit | **Calibration debt is outrunning #2.** Strain bands (15/12), TSB −25, IF effort bands, durability limiter map — all uncalibrated population constants added this session. Consolidate under ROADMAP **#2** (which these features keep deferring) rather than scattering more. |
| CR-12 | ☐ | P3 | bug | RaceSim requirement under-enforced — prompt says "per loading week", validator only checks ≥1/block. Tighten (needs loading-vs-recovery-week detection). [`session-requirements.ts`](lib/session-requirements.ts) |
| CR-13 | ☐ | P3 | ux | `illness: "mild"` force-downgrades even at minimal strain — likely too blunt; consider "proceed easy" for mild + low strain. [`morning-check.ts`](lib/morning-check.ts) |
| CR-14 | ☐ | P3 | bug | Durability rotation reads the *old active* block's stamp → regenerate-before-write reselects the same template; pre-feature/first blocks always start at A. Minor. [`durability.ts`](lib/durability.ts) + generate route |
| CR-15 | ☐ | P3 | audit | Both reschedule paths rewrite the local block only — the Intervals.icu calendar (system of record) stays stale. Bundle the calendar mutation with ROADMAP §7 bidirectional sync. [`reschedule.ts`](lib/reschedule.ts) |
| CR-16 | ☐ | P3 | audit | The "low-token spot-check" isn't cheap anymore — Ask-Coach now reads `interventionLog` + `morning-check` and runs the full synthesis chain (athlete model → insights → validation → directives) + snapshot on every question. Trim to what the spot-check actually needs if latency/cost shows. [`ask/route.ts`](app/api/ask/route.ts) |

_Design/judgment items also live in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md): power-zone SoT vs personal override; the
"Z2 dialed-in" overstatement; Recent-Baselines content / TSS-vs-Load naming; whether IF should be
replaced rather than annotated. Add new bugs/feedback here; strategy → [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)._
