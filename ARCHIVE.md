## Trends & Today card polish (TR batch)

From a real-use feedback pass on the Trends and Today pages.
- **TR-1 — Weekly-volume card compacted.** The Trends "Weekly volume" card is now half-width
  (paired in a `lg:grid-cols-2`, right column intentionally empty) to match the "Execution quality"
  card instead of spreading full-width. `components/Trends.tsx`
- **TR-2 — Weekly-volume colour-by-magnitude.** Bars are shaded across four blues relative to the
  window max (darker = bigger week), so volume reads by hue as well as height. `components/Trends.tsx`
- **TR-3 — Card ⓘ hovers.** `Card` gained a reusable `tip` prop rendering a `MetricTip` ⓘ next to
  the title; applied to the Weekly-volume + Execution-quality cards. `MetricTip` promoted from
  `components/dashboard/shared.tsx` to `components/ui.tsx` as a generic primitive. (Slice of ROADMAP
  "Popups where needed".)
- **TR-4 — Today metric strip.** Split the combined "NP / Avg" tile into distinct **NP** and **Avg
  power** tiles, kept **Avg speed**, and gave **IF** context (effort-band sublabel + ⓘ hover
  explaining NP÷FTP). Verified the tiles are correctly wired from sync (`app/api/sync/route.ts`) —
  a missing value means absent Intervals data, not a bug. `components/dashboard/today.tsx`

## Feedback sweep — all items cleared

A full pass over a feedback dump (bugs + UX + features), worked P1 → P3.

### Data integrity & interval detection
- **DI-1 — plan-vs-detection mismatch guard.** `matchPrescription` flags `structuralMismatch`
  (every rep ~half its prescribed length yet power nailed + rep count matched = a plan-definition
  vs detection mismatch, not a bail). Scoring drops the untrustworthy duration penalty; the coach
  note + Today card explain it. `lib/interval-match.ts`
- **DI-2 — interval power mis-read.** Adherence now reads `avgWatts` (what was actually held), not
  NP (which overstates short/variable efforts by 20%+). NP is kept only to filter warm-up/recovery
  laps out of the work band. `lib/interval-match.ts`
- **DI-3 — mid-ride added intervals.** Executed work efforts beyond the prescribed count are
  captured as `extras` and shown as dashed "+extra" chips instead of being silently dropped.
- **DI-4 / PW-10 — power-PR recognition.** New PRs surfaced to the coach note (called out first)
  and as a 🏆 trophy banner on Today with the gain over the prior best. `lib/pr.ts`

### Workout protocol & vocabulary
- **PW-2 — SIT consistency.** SIT progress marker moved from 1-min to 30-sec power to match the
  30s all-out protocol; all surfaces (KB, validator, prompt, Ask-Coach, marker) now agree.
- **PW-7 / PW-8 — KB-grounded protocols.** `lib/workout-validate.ts` flags generated workouts that
  violate KB interval protocols (SIT 4–6×20–30s @ 130–200%, VO2max 3–8min @ 106–120%, threshold
  88–105%); the same rules are stated in the generation prompt — guard on both ends.
- **PW-1 — standing-sprint technique.** KB distinguishes seated SIT (aerobic, consistent power)
  from standing sprints (neuromuscular/race skill) + technique cues; generation coaches standing
  only on dedicated sprint/RaceSim work.
- **PW-3 — RaceSim as a real workout type.** Added `RaceSim` to `WorkoutType` (+ styles, nutrition
  factor, execution band, reschedule quality list, generation TYPE list, KB protocol): variable
  race-moves, peaking/event-window use, scored on intensity not rep-match.
- **PW-9 — terrain-flexible sessions.** KB + generation rule to prescribe structured-but-flexible
  outdoor quality (target efforts as ranges + a placement rule + strict-Z2/HR-cap floor), scored
  on intrinsic quality. Keep one fixed ERG benchmark per week.
- **PW-4 / PW-5 — execution cues in descriptions.** Optional `Execution:` line in the DESCRIPTION
  format + KB-grounded cues (HR-ceiling on hilly Z2, sit-down sprints, descents as cornering
  practice). `lib/anthropic-api.ts`

### Coaching context
- **PW-6 — Ask-Coach sees the next session.** The coach now gets the nearest upcoming session's
  exact prescription ("do not invent durations") — kills the "4-min for a 30s SIT day"
  hallucination. `app/api/ask/route.ts`, `lib/anthropic-api.ts`
- **#9 — all-time power PRs.** `fetchPowerCurveAllTime()` pulls Intervals.icu's `curves=all` into
  `SyncData.powerCurveAllTime`; the Profile shows all-time bests and PR detection uses the all-time
  curve as a monotonic baseline (no window false-drops, true all-time deltas), with an 84-day
  fallback. `lib/intervals-api.ts`, `lib/pr.ts`
- **NUT-6 — nutrition formula audit (pass).** Verified: weight is live-synced, the buffer is
  weight-trend-adaptive + clamped (0–600) and skipped on rest days, carbs scale by mass (glycogen)
  while protein is flat (MPS saturates). Sound; the real enhancement (energy-availability signal)
  is ROADMAP §6.

### Today / Plan / Trends UX
- **TODAY-1 — ride-card de-dup.** Merged NP + Avg into one tile and dropped TSS (identical to
  Intervals' "Load"); 6 → 4 metric tiles.
- **TODAY-6 / TODAY-8 — ACWR & TSB tooltips.** What they are, calc basis, good/concerning bands.
- **TODAY-7 — session-state fix.** The calendar showed *compromised* rides as "Missed" (they're
  excluded from `scores`). Threaded `compromisedDates`/`partialDates` through sync → state →
  calendar; compromised now reads "Compromised — ridden, excluded from scoring", partial reads
  "Partial". `missed` confirmed correctly auto-derived.
- **TODAY-2 / TODAY-3 / TODAY-5** — power-zone bar labels → hover tooltip; Trend-Pulse per-week
  hover + "this wk" label; ride-card energy unit kJ → kcal.
- **PLAN-3** — audited; "This week" Hours/TSS aren't duplicated on the Plan page itself, left as-is.
- **TRENDS-1** — Pw:HR excludes indoor rides (distorted power:HR); ≥45-min + endurance-band +
  Intervals' efficiency-factor method. `lib/trends.ts`
- **TRENDS-2** — fueling/weight graph shows complete weeks only (drops the partial current week).
- **TRENDS-3** — replaced trivial 7-day avg RPE with an actionable 7-day training-load total.
- **UI-5 — ride-card power trace.** 30s rolling-mean smoothing tames the jumpy line; short
  work-interval bands get a minimum width + stronger fill so 30s reps are visible; band-alignment
  fixed (bands sit exactly under the line). `lib/trace.ts`, `components/RideTrace.tsx`

## Platform & performance (P-series)

The local-first cost / robustness / observability hardening, in order. Forward items live under
ROADMAP "Platform & performance"; P4 is partially done (1 of 4 items shipped).

- **P1 — Prompt caching + singleton Anthropic client.** One lazily-constructed `Anthropic`
  client reused across all calls (was `new Anthropic()` per call ×4) for connection pooling.
  Generation's system prompt is split into a cached prefix (persona + workout-syntax guide +
  reference KB, marked `cache_control: ephemeral`) and a dynamic tail (carry-forward seeds +
  directives + athlete data + block params), so a repeat generation within the cache TTL re-reads
  the bulk at ~0.1× input cost. A test locks the invariant that per-block dynamic content never
  leaks into the cached prefix (which would defeat the cache). `lib/anthropic-api.ts`,
  `app/api/generate/route.ts`.
- **P2 — Structured generation via tool-use.** Generation no longer regex-parses Claude's
  markdown — it forces a `submit_training_block` tool whose `input_schema` is derived (via
  `z.toJSONSchema`) from one shared zod schema (`lib/plan-schema.ts`), which also validates the
  response. The route maps the typed output → `PlannedDay[]` and falls back to the regex parser
  (`plan-parser.ts`, retained) only if the tool payload is absent/malformed. `workout-validate`
  stays as the coaching-validity guard (tool-use is only *schema*-valid). Added `zod` v4. New
  schema/mapping tests. `lib/plan-schema.ts`, `lib/anthropic-api.ts`, `app/api/generate/route.ts`.
- **P3 — Decoupled sync + surfaced warnings.** `/api/sync` now returns fast with the
  deterministic analysis (metrics, zones, intervals, PRs, execution score) and defers only the slow
  LLM coach note to a follow-up `/api/analyze` (extracted `lib/sync-analysis.ts addCoachNote`,
  idempotent — preserves a note across re-syncs, auto-posts once). PR detection stays in the fast
  path (it needs the pre-sync curve). Non-fatal step failures (intervention validation, ride
  analysis, coach note) now collect into a `warnings[]` array surfaced in the nav rail instead of
  being swallowed by best-effort catches; the Today card shows "Analysing today's ride…" while the
  note lands. `app/api/sync/route.ts`, `app/api/analyze/route.ts`, `lib/sync-analysis.ts`,
  `components/SyncProvider.tsx`, `components/Nav.tsx`, `components/Dashboard.tsx`.
- **P4 (item 4 of 4 — section COMPLETE) — Generation dedupe.** Decision: a **short dedupe-only
  window**, not a long reuse cache (generation runs at temperature 0.3, so a considered regenerate is
  partly *for* the variation). `lib/generate-cache.ts dedupeGeneration(key, compute)` keys on a sha256
  of the three assembled prompt parts and runs `compute` at most once per key while it's in flight +
  ~60 s after it completes — so a double-click or a second request landing mid-generation shares the
  one Claude call, a failure evicts immediately so retries re-run, and a deliberate regenerate
  outside the window re-calls. In-memory + single-process (same assumption as the singleton client; a
  restart just forgets the window). Wired into `app/api/generate/route.ts`. 6 new tests
  (in-flight dedupe, per-key, failure-evict, fake-timer window expiry). `lib/generate-cache.ts`.
- **P4 (item 3 of 4) — Stream `/api/ask`.** `streamAskCoach` (async generator) yields Anthropic text
  deltas as they arrive and records usage from the final message; `/api/ask` wraps it in a plain-text
  `ReadableStream` (validation still returns JSON errors *before* the 200 stream; a mid-stream failure
  surfaces as the stream erroring); `AskCoach` reads `res.body` incrementally and renders the reply as
  it streams ("thinking…" only until the first token). `lib/anthropic-api.ts`, `app/api/ask/route.ts`,
  `components/AskCoach.tsx`. Type-checked + build-verified; live token path needs a real Anthropic key
  to exercise. _P4 now has only generation caching left — blocked on the regenerate-vs-cache product
  question (ROADMAP)._
- **P4 (item 2 of 4) — Coach-accuracy % on the dashboard.** `overallCoachAccuracy(log)` rolls the
  intervention validation loop into one headline hit-rate (validated / decisive across all
  dimensions; null until the 28-day horizon produces a decisive outcome). Computed in the `/api/sync`
  GET handler, carried on `AppState.coachAccuracy`, surfaced as a compact line in the Today
  Trend-pulse zone — hidden entirely until there's a decisive % *or* pending interventions, so it
  never shows an empty tile on a fresh install. `lib/intervention.ts`, `app/api/sync/route.ts`,
  `components/SyncProvider.tsx`, `components/Dashboard.tsx`. 2 new tests.
- **P4 (item 1 of 4) — Token/cost tracker.** `lib/ai-usage.ts` folds every Anthropic call's
  `usage` into `data/ai-usage.json` (best-effort, fire-and-forget — never blocks the request; a
  serialized read-modify-write chain prevents lost increments under concurrency). Cost is estimated
  from a per-model price table (sonnet-4-6 $3/$15, haiku-4-5 $1/$5 per 1M) with the cache-write
  premium (1.25×) and cache-read discount (0.1×) applied to the input rate. `recordUsage` wired into
  all four call sites (generate, ride analysis, retrospective, ask-coach); `AiUsageCard` shows total
  + per-model spend on the (now dynamic) Settings page. Pure `estimateCostUsd` unit-tested.
  `lib/ai-usage.ts`, `lib/anthropic-api.ts`, `components/AiUsageCard.tsx`, `app/settings/page.tsx`.
  (P4 is now complete — items 2/3/4 above.)
- **P5 — Deterministic schedule validator.** Generation was *instructed* to space quality
  sessions ("avoid back-to-back hard days") and cap them at the weekly budget, but nothing enforced
  placement — `workout-validate.ts` checks each session's protocol bands in isolation. New
  `lib/schedule-validate.ts validateSchedule(days, settings)` does a post-generation pass over the
  block's day sequence and flags (a) two hard/quality days on consecutive calendar dates (by date
  adjacency, so it spans the week boundary and never false-pairs across a gap) and (b) any week over
  the `qualitySessionsPerLoadingWeek` budget. Quality set = Threshold/VO2max/SIT/**RaceSim** (RaceSim
  counts toward the budget + spacing). Folded into the generate route's `warnings[]` next to the
  protocol checks — warns only, never reorders. 11 new tests. `lib/schedule-validate.ts`,
  `app/api/generate/route.ts`.
- **P6 — Reliability & resilience quick-wins.** Five independent hardening wins:
  - **Error boundaries** — `app/error.tsx` (route-segment fallback; the nav rail above it stays
    mounted) + `app/global-error.tsx` (root-shell fallback). Use Next 16's `unstable_retry` prop
    (not `reset` — verified against `node_modules/next/dist/docs`).
  - **Provenance stamping** — `PROMPT_VERSION` constant + `model`/`promptVersion` (optional) on
    `GeneratedPlan`, `TodayAnalysis`, `BlockHistoryEntry`, `CurrentBlock`, stamped at generation /
    coach-note time and carried through block archive → history; makes past AI outputs auditable
    when the model or prompt later changes. `lib/anthropic-api.ts`, `lib/types.ts`, generate/write/
    retrospective routes, `lib/sync-analysis.ts`.
  - **Export / import backup** — `GET /api/export` bundles `data/*.json` + `knowledge-base/**/*.md`
    into one downloadable JSON (no zip dep); `POST /api/import` restores it, guarded (must self-id as
    a NodeVelo backup, path-traversal-confined, data files go through `writeJsonFile` so critical
    stores keep their pre-import `.bak`). Settings "Backup & restore" card. `components/BackupRestore.tsx`.
  - **json-store per-file write mutex** — concurrent writes to the same store chain one-at-a-time
    (last-write-wins) so a sync + disposition POST can't clobber the shared temp file; different
    files stay parallel. Data dir made env-overridable (`NODEVELO_DATA_DIR`) for test isolation.
    `lib/json-store.ts` + new mutex/round-trip tests.
  - **Manual re-analyse** — `addCoachNote(today, warnings, force)` regenerates today's coach note on
    demand (force bypasses the idempotency guard); `/api/analyze` reads `force`; `SyncProvider`
    exposes `reAnalyse`; the Today coach-note card shows a re-analyse / "generate note" button so an
    Anthropic hiccup is recoverable without a full re-sync. The sync route already preserves a good
    note + its stamp across a re-sync (never overwrites with empty).

- **P7 — TanStack Query data layer.** Replaced the hand-rolled cache (`SyncProvider`'s
  fetch-on-mount `useEffect` + a separate `useEffect` fetch in Trends) with `@tanstack/react-query`
  v5. New `QueryProvider` (one `QueryClient`, `staleTime` 30 s, `refetchOnWindowFocus` +
  `refetchOnReconnect` + retry) wraps the app above `SyncProvider`. The `['sync']` GET is now a
  `useQuery`; Trends uses `useQuery(['trends', syncedAt])` (re-fetches when a sync completes, plus
  focus/reconnect/dedup/retry). Crucially the **`useSync()` context API is unchanged** — `state`
  comes from the query, and `setState` writes through to the query cache via `setQueryData`, so
  every existing `setState(...)` call in `doSync`/`runAnalysis`/`RescheduleBanner` keeps working and
  Nav/Dashboard/RescheduleBanner needed no changes. `doSync` (the POST that hits Intervals.icu) and
  the deferred `/api/analyze` step stay explicit actions that write results back into the cache.
  Fixes the "stale after an overnight tab" UX. Verified: tsc/build/lint clean, 211 tests, dev server
  boots and Today/Trends render with the new provider wiring. `components/QueryProvider.tsx`,
  `components/SyncProvider.tsx`, `components/Trends.tsx`, `app/layout.tsx`, `package.json`
  (`@tanstack/react-query`). _Deferred:_ `doSync`→`useMutation` + optimistic updates (not needed for
  the win).

## Signal fusion — Athlete State v1 (ROADMAP §5)

- **`computeAthleteState` (the fused glance).** `lib/athlete-state.ts` collapses the parallel signals
  the brain otherwise surfaces (and lets contradict) — TSB, ACWR, execution-trend (EWMA), decoupling
  vs the 90d baseline, RPE recent-vs-baseline, off-plan behaviour — into one **0–100 score** + band
  (`primed/ready/steady/strained/depleted`) + recommendation + `drivers[]` + confidence. Built as a
  **list of signal evaluators** (add energy-availability later = one evaluator); score = base + Σ
  effects, clamped, then a **lived-signal override** (≥2 of execution-down / decoupling-up / RPE-up
  cap the score even when TSB looks fresh — corroborated fatigue beats a fresh load model). All
  weights/thresholds are named constants in one block (foundations — built to be tuned). Deterministic;
  the AI only phrases the headline. 8 directional tests (not pinned to exact numbers). Design spec:
  `docs/specs/athlete-state.md`.
- **Surfaced + consumed (all three).** `AthleteStateCard` on Today — the 0–100 score is the glance,
  band + drivers reveal on hover (above the individual signals, not replacing them). Computed in the
  `/api/sync` GET **and** POST (so it refreshes after a sync), carried on `AppState.athleteState`.
  Folded into **generation** (a fused-state directive line) and **Ask-Coach** (context), both via the
  pure `athleteStateInputsFrom` adapter. `lib/athlete-state.ts`, `app/api/sync/route.ts`,
  `app/api/generate/route.ts`, `app/api/ask/route.ts`, `lib/anthropic-api.ts`,
  `components/AthleteStateCard.tsx`, `components/SyncProvider.tsx`, `components/Dashboard.tsx`,
  `lib/types.ts`. (v1 foundations; tuning + energy-availability + per-athlete weights remain — ROADMAP §5.)

## Metric-consistency + Today/Trends UX (feedback batch)

A batch of real-use feedback, routed through todo.md (MR/UX/RC) and cleared:
- **MR-1 — IF basis consistency.** The coach-note prompt (`analyseRide`) computed IF from *avg*
  watts while the Today card + `score-log` use NP (`normalizedPower ?? avgWatts`). Made the note
  NP-based too (and ftp>0-guarded), so the note's IF can't disagree with the card; fixed the stale
  `// avg watts / FTP` comment on `TodayAnalysis.intensityFactor`. (NP was already synced from
  `icu_normalized_power`.) `lib/anthropic-api.ts`, `lib/types.ts`.
- **MR-2 — Weekly-hours window.** Recent-Baselines "Weekly hours" was an all-logged-window mean
  while its sibling tiles are 90-day rolling. Added `avgWeeklyHours90d` to `RollingBaselines`
  (computed in `computeRollingBaselines` as total hours ÷ 90/7 over the same 90d window); the card
  now reads it, so all four tiles share one horizon. Populates on the next sync. `lib/readiness.ts`,
  `lib/types.ts`, `lib/data-store.ts`, `components/Trends.tsx`.
- **RC-1 — Avg speed on the Today ride card.** Threaded `activityDistanceMeters` onto `TodayAnalysis`
  (sync route) and added an "Avg speed" tile (distance ÷ moving time). Populates on the next sync.
  `lib/types.ts`, `app/api/sync/route.ts`, `components/Dashboard.tsx`.
- **UX-1 — Power bar horizontal overflow.** `ZoneBars` segments had `shrink-0` + `gap-px`, so widths
  summed past 100% and the bar overflowed on narrow cards. Switched to `min-w-0` (let flex absorb the
  gap). `components/Dashboard.tsx`.
- **UX-2 — Trend-pulse "Weekly volume" tile dead-end.** The tile pushed to /trends, which had no
  weekly-volume view. Added a "Weekly volume" card (`WeeklyVolumeBars` over the existing
  `data.weeklyHours`) so the click lands somewhere. `components/Trends.tsx`.
- **UX-3 — Execution-quality card compression + hover.** `ScoreBars` (capped at 24) used
  `min-w-[4px]` + `gap-[3px]` (~165px min → overflowed narrow cards); reduced to `min-w-[2px]` +
  `gap-px` (~71px) and added a `hover:opacity` affordance on top of the existing per-bar title.
  `components/Trends.tsx`.

## Foundations & earlier milestones

- **Timezone-correct "today" (code-audit fix).** The server matched today's ride on a UTC date
  while activities carry their *local* date, so an evening ride could be missed entirely (no
  analysis/PR). `lib/date.ts` now makes the client's local date the single source of "today"
  (client sends it; server prefers it, UTC fallback). No date-fns dep.
- **Disposition flag + learning gate.** Athlete marks Completed / Partial / Compromised(reason);
  compromised rides stay as history but are excluded from the execution EWMA + metric and surfaced
  to Ask-Coach, so a fluke can't be misread as under-recovery. `data/dispositions.json`
- **Auto-reschedule engine.** `lib/reschedule.ts` + `/api/reschedule` + RescheduleBanner detects a
  not-delivered quality session and suggests/applies a make-up on the next clear rest day in the
  local block (no back-to-back hard days), athlete-confirmed.
- **UI refinements (audit images 1–5).** Readiness card trimmed to TSB/ACWR/Polarization; Trend
  Pulse reworked to CTL + weekly-volume + time-in-zone bars; Trends compacted to a 2-col pair;
  Profile modernized to match the other pages.
- **Calibration v1.** Auto-tuned EWMA α + ACWR bands with a manual override (`lib/calibration.ts`).
- **Synthesis.** One ranked coaching-directive block fed to generation; dropped redundant
  `compliance-memory`.
- **Closed learning loop.** All rides scored into the immutable ledger; interventions snapshotted
  at block-write and later validated/refuted.
- **Atomic writes + ledger backup/recovery** (`lib/json-store.ts`).
- **Compliance unified** into the execution/completion index; duration-aware interval scoring;
  time-in-zone polarization; physiology single-source-of-truth; Ask-Coach (block + form context).
